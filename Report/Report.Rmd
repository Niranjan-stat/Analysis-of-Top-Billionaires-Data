## About the Data

We scraped information about the top 500 billionaires of the world for the years 2011 to 2019 and 2021 from [Areppim](https://stats.areppim.com). Areppim is an information website that provides and analyses various kinds of data. It has collected data from [Forbes Billionaire List](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires) for data before 2019 and [Bloomberg Billionaires Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires) after 2019 (and including).

The variables extracted are as follows:

- **Name**
    - *character*
    - Person's name
- **Age**
    - *integer*
    - Person's age
- **Citizenship**
    - *factor* of countries
    - Person's citizenship
- **Net Worth**
    - *numeric*
    - The total market value of the assets removing the value of the liabilities associated to a person or an entity.
- **Source of Wealth**
    - *factor*
    - The wealth was acquired from what kind of industry. The industries have been grouped in the following categories:
        - Commodities
        - Consumer
        - Diversified
        - Energy
        - Entertainment
        - Finance
        - Food and Beverage
        - Health Care
        - Industrial
        - Media and Telecom
        - Real Estate
        - Retail
        - Services
        - Technology


The data consists of 500 rows across 10 years, thus, 5000 data points with 5 variables along with ordering indicating the rank.

We also have additional variables for every country for 2021:

- Population
- GDP
- Population Density
- GDP Growth Rate

and for every billionaire:

- Last Change YTD

To create the world map plots, we also created a data frame with the variables:

- Country Name
- 3-digit ISO Country Code ([ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3))

This data frame consists of 64 countries, the countries which had at least one billionaire in top 500 over the 10 years.

## Biases in the Data:

- **Bias in Methodology:** We have scraped the data of 2011 to 2021 (except 2020) from [Areppim](https://stats.areppim.com/stats/links_billionairexlists.htm) website where it was mentioned that the data they are presenting was taken from **Bloomberg Billionaires Index** from 2019 and previously from **Forbes Billionaires List**.

  - The methodology of data collection of [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/methodology/) is different.

  - Date of data collection of those websites was also different for those two websites. Since, the wealth of a person varies daily, some bias may have been introduced by this.

- **Bias in Categories of Source of Income:** The sources of wealth have been categorized under 14 categories. At times, a source of income could have belonged to two or more categories, in that case, the most relevant category was chosen.

## Conclusion

The answers to the posed questions are purely data-driven based on the visualizations. The highlights of our analysis were:

- Technology industry has had a huge jump in the 2019-21 period along with Elon Musk in the global ranking.
- As it turns out, having a high number of billionaires or a high total net worth in a country doesn't guarantee one would have the highest net worth there.
- Even among the Top 500, the Top 20-25 are the actually the most wealthy with much higher net worth as compared to others being ranked.
- In the period 2019-21, the Net Worth of the Top 20-25 has become 1.5-2 times.
- The Age range of 40-80 years has remained static over the years, and data doesn't indicate any change in this trend.
- There was no relation found between GDP of the country or the population with the Number or the Net Worth of the billionaires.
- Women representation remains low in the Top billionaires of the world.
- The proportion of women in the billionaires list has been increasing over the past 10 years.
